We've been on the road for this longer trip from mid-July to mid-December.
It was our intention to return to our families for christmas, but also because winter is more comfortable in a house than in a van.
All in all, it went quite well for us, we could roughly follow the planned path, around the coast of France, Spain and Portugal (even England with Gibraltar).
We were in time for Camille's hypnosis training in Avignon, and she graduated.
Also, we almost forgot about the pandemic, as we didn't have a TV and didn't meet much people either (vanlife is rather lonely).
Here is a map of our trips (compiled from google location history data), which puts this trip in perspective to the previous, shorter ones.

I've shared the nice landscape pictures on our [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/vanderfool.fr/).
In this blog post, I'll talk about the broader picture of our vanlife, together with plots of data that I gathered.

## Thermal comfort in the van


## How much did it cost?

We've tracked all our expenses during the trip, also because it made splitting the bills easier.
Talking to other travellers, it looks like we are on the high-end of the spectrum with respect to spending.
All in all, we've spent 11430€ within 144 days, that's an average of 2381€ per month for the two of us.
I believe this figure slightly higher than what we were spending while living in Germany, although we didn't track expenses back then so who knows.

</div>

It's good that we were able to work almost full-time while on the road, so we could live like high-rollers.
Food in general (groceries and restaurants) represented 49% of the total expenses.
We spent on average 183€ per week in restaurants - we occasionally call ourself foodies now.
To entertain ourself further with sporting activities, museums and so on, we spend 17% of the budget, accounting for 404€ per month.
Camping only represented 8% of our total expenses, which averages to 190€ per month.
This is much fewer than the 800€ we were paying for rent in Germany, even when adding up our gas/fuel consumption for driving around (381€/month).
We did our best to drive as much as possible on GNC (bio if available), which was much cheaper per km than E10 petrol: 0.10€/km for GNC versus 0.25€/km for E10.
The category "other" accounts mainly for local gifts we bought for friends and family, as well as public transportation.

## Carbon footprint

Lifestyle in the van was rather sober since we did not have much space to start with.
The two big chunks of our carbon footprint was meat-eating and - obviously - the fuel required for driving around.
I did not track our diet, but I did track our fuel consumption rather accurately.

For heating and cooking, we had a 13kg gas bottle which would probably have been sufficient for the whole trip.
We prefered replacing it before entering Spain, because they use a different format there and we didn't want to take the risk.
We cooked rather often with our two gas stove, but never too long, and we only sporadically turned the heater on for a few minutes.
One bottle of 13kg of gas accounts for 150kg CO2eq (CO2 equivalent).
